Modern JavaScript ES6+ Features

JavaScript ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) and subsequent versions have introduced numerous features that have transformed how developers write JavaScript code. Understanding these modern features is essential for building efficient and maintainable applications.

Arrow functions provide a concise way to write function expressions. They have a shorter syntax than traditional functions and automatically bind the this context from the enclosing scope. For example, const add = (a, b) => a + b is equivalent to function add(a, b) { return a + b; }.

Template literals use backticks and allow embedded expressions with ${expression} syntax. They support multi-line strings and make string interpolation much cleaner than concatenation. Template literals are particularly useful for HTML templating and dynamic string generation.

Destructuring assignment allows unpacking values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables. Array destructuring uses square brackets: const [first, second] = array, while object destructuring uses curly braces: const {name, age} = person. This feature significantly reduces code verbosity.

The spread operator (...) expands iterables into individual elements. It's useful for array concatenation, function arguments, and object cloning. For example, const newArray = [...array1, ...array2] combines two arrays without mutating the originals.

Promises and async/await provide elegant solutions for handling asynchronous operations. Promises represent eventual completion or failure of asynchronous operations, while async/await syntax makes asynchronous code look synchronous and easier to read.

Modules enable code organization through import and export statements. Named exports allow multiple exports per module, while default exports provide a single main export. Modern bundlers like Webpack and Vite handle module resolution and bundling.

Classes provide a cleaner syntax for constructor functions and prototype-based inheritance. They support constructor methods, instance methods, static methods, and inheritance through the extends keyword. Although they're syntactic sugar over prototypes, they make object-oriented programming more intuitive.
